# Be-Exotic
A chrome extension used to turn all images on webpages into photos of our beloved Tiger King.

I'm working on getting this extension published to the Chrome store, but the review process for that tends to take around a week, so here's a very simple way to add this to your list of chrome extensions in the meantime.

# Usage
1. Clone/Download this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/abryant2113/Be-Exotic.git
```
2. Open up chrome and proceed to the following url:
```
chrome://extensions/
```
3. Click the toggle in the top right corner of the page to enable developer mode
4. Click **Load unpacked** in the top left corner
5. Navigate to the folder that you downloaded and click okay.

Now you should see the extension show up in your list of installed extensions. :)
